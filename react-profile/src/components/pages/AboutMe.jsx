      <p>
        I'm Yasmin! I am an aspiring software engineer. I have no college background in coding, but I have taken 3 coding bootcamps and have taken a self-taught route to gain the knowledge I have thus far. Currently I am attending a Full Stack program through the University of Minnesota. It's been a journey and a blessing these 6 months I have attended this bootcamp. I graduate late October 2023.

        <p>
        Preservering despite life's obstacles on and off through these years, learning how to code and build websites, I have shown tenancity and grit. I am determined to be an expert in the field. Coding has become my life. Once, programming was my enemy, but now it is my passion.
